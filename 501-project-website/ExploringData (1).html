    <h1>Exploring Data</h1>
    
    <h2>R: </h2>
    <p>
        We can now start looking at the data and doing some basic exploratory 
        analysis. There are a few simple charts about the data that make up the 
        preliminary study at first. The graphic below illustrates how long games
        are. Bins with a width of 1 are used in the histogram to accurately 
        depict game duration. As can be seen, most games run between 25 and 35 
        minutes on average, however some go on for much longer. Although the 
        game is intended to last around thirty minutes, some intense matches may
        go as long as forty-five minutes. This dataset mostly confirms that, 
        with the vast majority of the games fitting inside those parameters. 
        From a development standpoint, it seems that game duration has been 
        perfected.

        A statistic known as first blood keeps track of which team was the first
        to remove a player from the other squad. Even though elimination is only
        temporary, it often gives a team a boost and raises their chances of 
        victory when members from the other side are absent. It would be 
        reasonable to assume that this statistic would be helpful in forecasting
        game results. The first blood graph demonstrates that the blue side wins
        somewhat more often. Although this may first seem strange, it is not 
        reason for alarm since it doesn't seem the game's fairness is inherently
        flawed.

        First tower is a simple measure that tracks which team was the first to 
        knock down a tower belonging to the other team out of the 11 towers that
        belong to each side. It is a measure that might be helpful in 
        identifying which side is ahead in the early going. We can observe from 
        this graph that the blue team destroys the first tower more often. 
        Although it could be a matter of chance, developers need to take this 
        into account to give gamers the impression that they have an equal 
        chance. Since the game is always played from the same isometric 
        perspective, it might be claimed that many players who have played the 
        training mode (playing as the blue team) are more comfortable with the 
        blue team layout (playing bottom left to top right).

        The first inhibitor is comparable to the first tower data point, except 
        instead of being the tower, it is the inhibitor, which is located deeper
        into each team's base and provides a stronger indication of who has the 
        edge as the game progresses. There are no inhibitors removed in many of 
        the games that are shown here. This indicates that the game has not been
        played all the way through but may be the result of a side giving up 
        after gaining an enormous lead.

        The distribution of which team removed the first dragon is shown in the 
        graph up top. It's interesting that both teams may attempt to complete 
        this goal, which looks to be shared. It is also noteworthy that the red 
        team had more eliminations than the blue team in first dragon, one of 
        only two measures where this is true. This seems to be a random 
        occurrence, although it is commonly known that dragons spawn off-center,
        thus it could be something to take into account for future advancements.

        The blue team seems to be edging out the red team, which is consistent 
        with the patterns that most data suggest. The first rift herald also 
        displays an astonishing number of matches in which neither side was able
        to destroy one. The game's rift herald is not there for the full 
        duration; after the twenty-minute mark has been reached, the baron takes
        its place. However, considering that they seem to lose minimally in most
        other data, the red team does appear to remove the first baron often 
        enough to justify inquiry.

        Firstly, I extract the top five languages appeared in these tweets. This
        reflects the popularity of the game in these language used regions 
        around the world from the side. So that is convenient for me to show 
        that the following keywords appeared in the tweets, and then I can 
        introduce the contrentration of the world championship. The third 
        picture show that the support for 6 representative teams among the 
        world championship this year.

        Here we can see firstInhibitor's direct impact on choosing the winner. 
        The outcomes are largely the same as those of the first inhibitor. We 
        may argue that a side has a better chance of winning the game if they 
        obtain the first baron. We could still see a clear correlation between 
        the first riftherald and the likelihood of winning, even if the rate is 
        smaller than the preceding ones. Consider them as a heatmap.
