        <h1>Data Gathering</h2>
        
        <h2>R:</h2>
        <p>
            In order to create wordclouds in the future, I utilize the API in 
            Rstudio to scratch the phrase "League of legends." I also use this 
            dataset to get a variety of knowledge about the game.
        </p>

        <h2>Python:</h2>
        <p>
            To obtain all relevant information from Twitter regarding LOL, I 
            utilize the twitter API to scratch many keywords such as League of 
            Legends, Rank, victory rate, use, and KDA. I'll utilize this 
            information to evaluate the situation around these words and learn 
            more about it in order to more easily make a future forecast. In 
            order to create thorough datasets, I also use a for loop to scan 
            through more than 600 tweets. In order to ensure that my findings 
            are correct, I will continue to gather additional information and 
            scratch over 2,000 tweets.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Method</h2>
        <p>
            This data inludes before the game began (df pre start): summoners 
            spells, draft, and banns. During the game, the major goals are 
            (drakes, towers, inibs, barons, and heralds). The longer the game 
            lasts, the more probable it is that we will be able to determine the
            winner. It would be highly fascinating, but also very challenging, 
            to be able to predict the winner using just the df pre start data. 
            The data may be used to determine which objectives have the most 
            effect on the games, which is more interesting than using df post 
            start to predict the winner. I'll proceed from little to huge since 
            this is a test, to assure substance.
