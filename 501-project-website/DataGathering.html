            In order to create wordclouds in the future, I utilize the API in 
            Rstudio to scratch the phrase "League of legends." I also use this 
            dataset to get a variety of knowledge about the game.

        <h2>Python:</h2>
        <p>
            To obtain all relevant information from Twitter regarding LOL, I 
            utilize the twitter API to scratch many keywords such as League of 
            Legends, Rank, victory rate, use, and KDA. I'll utilize this 
            information to evaluate the situation around these words and learn 
            more about it in order to more easily make a future forecast. In 
            order to create thorough datasets, I also use a for loop to scan 
            through more than 600 tweets. In order to ensure that my findings 
            are correct, I will continue to gather additional information and 
            scratch over 2,000 tweets.
